### Test Case 1
a) The pull requests found here: https://github.com/ranaroussi/yfinance/pull/619, https://github.com/ranaroussi/yfinance/pull/497, 
https://github.com/ranaroussi/yfinance/pull/174 attempt to implement a solution to the problem found in this test case. We assume there
is something wrong with implementing these PRs since they were closed and not merged.

b) No, this is not because the fix is hard, but because we were unable to replicate the errors on our own machines. This either means that
a fix has been implemented, or that it is hard-to-reproduce error (or our testing is poor).
